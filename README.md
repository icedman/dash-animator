# IMPORTANT!

Development of this extension will be limited to bugs and essential/minimal features. Please use Dash2Dock Lite for Animated and Effects-ful Dock.

*Update*

I'll myfocus effort instead on three other extensions (Search Light, Dash2Dock Lite, Anino Dock).

[search light](https://github.com/icedman/search-light)

[dash2dock lite](https://github.com/icedman/dash2dock-lite)

[anino dock](https://github.com/icedman/anino-dock)

Anino Dock will be released soon on EGO. It is based on Dash2Dock Lite (release #20);
Dash2Dock Lite will be made "lightweight" again. The aim would to make it Anino Dock Lite;

# Dash Animator for Ubuntu

This is a Gnome Shell extension that animates the Ubuntu Dock, or more precisely, the Dash-to-Dock extension.

This works with other distribution using Dash-to-Dock extensions.


Check out also Dash2Dock lite which is a total replacement of Dash-to-Dock. It is also animated:
